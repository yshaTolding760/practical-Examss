  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Tulips are perennial, bulbous plants known for their
    graceful, cup-shaped blooms that come in a wide range of colors, including red, yellow, pink, purple, and even
    multicolored varieties. Belonging to the *Liliaceae* family, tulips are native to Central Asia and were brought to
    Europe in the 16th century, where they became particularly famous in the Netherlands. Tulip flowers typically bloom
    in the spring and can grow between 6 and 24 inches tall, depending on the variety. They are cherished for their
    symbolism of love, rebirth, and prosperity and are a staple in gardens, floral arrangements, and festivals
    worldwide. The plant thrives in well-drained
    soil and requires a period of cold dormancy to bloom successfully.</p>
